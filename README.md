BLE Message Board
==========
For a class project we made this deal for iOS 7 (on an iPhone 4S or above, or any iOS device that supports Bluetooth 4) where you can just show up and start a message board.  As long as people are talking about the same thing (ie same topic/tag/subject/whatever) and there's enough folks around you end up with a level of persistence.

The topic name goes in the box on the upper left.  Your name is hackily parsed from your "Joe's iPhone" device name.  I think by default only the last 5 minutes of messages are pulled.   There's a global variable you can change for that.  Actually there are a ton of global variables!

You may have to wait a while for messages to propagate.  This is more of a proof of concept than anything, at this point, although I do want to make this an actual usable app.  And then make an Android app that can participate in this message board thing, so long as at least 1 iOS device is present.

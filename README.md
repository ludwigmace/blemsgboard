BLE Message Board
==========
For a class project we made this deal for iOS 7 (on an iPhone 4S or above, or any iOS device that support Bluetooth 4) where you can just show up and start a message board.  Topic name goes in the box on the upper left.  Your name is hackily parsed from your "Joe's iPhone" device name.  I think by default only the last 5 minutes of messages are pulled.  You may have to wait a while for messages to propagate.  I'm going to take a week or so off and make this an actual usable app, then make an Android app that can participate in a message board so long as at least 1 iOS device is present.
